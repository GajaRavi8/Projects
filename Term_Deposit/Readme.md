This data set contains records relevant to a direct marketing campaign of a Portuguese banking institution.
The marketing campaign was executed through phone calls. 
Often, more than one call needs to be made to a single client before they either decline or agree to a term deposit subscription. 
The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe (yes/no) to the term deposit (variable y).

Use this data set to test the performance of your classification models and to explore the best strategies to improve a banking institution's next direct marketing campaign.

Term deposits are cash investment held at a financial institution and are a major source of revenue for banks--making them important for financial institutions to market. 
Telemarketing remains to be a popular marketing technique because of the potential effectiveness of human-to-human contact provided by a telephone call, 
which is sometimes quite the opposite of many impersonal and robotic marketing messages relayed through social and digital media. 
However, executing such direct marketing effort usually requires a huge investment by the business as large call centers need to be contracted to contact clients directly.
